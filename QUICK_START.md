## 🌐 What You'll Get

**Live URL**: `https://realsync-[random].vercel.app`

### ✅ Working Features:
- Professional login/registration UI
- Responsive design (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- Beautiful dashboard layouts

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "Can't find frontend/web"
→ Make sure Root Directory is set to `frontend/web` in Vercel

### "Build failed"
→ Check Vercel build logs
→ Test build locally: `cd frontend/web && npm run build`

### "404 on pages"
→ Already fixed! `vercel.json` handles routing

### "Login doesn't work"
→ Expected! Backend not deployed yet
→ UI should still work perfectly
